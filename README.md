# ViewPagerUpdateDemo
Android ViewPager update data and modify the page count.

#Explain
the viewpager has been added some fragments.  
When the data has been changed,the fragment in this viewpager should update the view.  
When the data count is over the limit of the page count, we need to add one more fragment.  
When the data has been deleted and leave a empty page, we need to delete the fragment.
